Description: Helper functions to implement univariate and bivariate latent change score models (LCSM) in R using the lavaan package.
  The package generates lavaan syntax for different model specifications and varying timepoints.
  The lavaan syntax generated by the package can be returned and further specifications can be added manually.
  Longitudinal plots as well as simplified path diagrams can be created to visualise data and model specifications.
  Longitudinal plots help to visualise data and simplified path diagrams illustrate the selected model specifications.
  Estimated model parameters and fit statistics can be extracted as dataframes.
  Data for different univariate and bivariate LCSM can be simulated by specifying estimates for model parameters to explore the effects of different parameters.
  This package combines the strengths of other R packages like lavaan, broom, and semPlot by generating lavaan syntax that helps these packages work together.
