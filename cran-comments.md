## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.
The title does no longer include the R package name.
I have added two citations including the doi to the description of this package.
The typo in the broken URL https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.60.110707.16361 has been corrected.
The size of the package has been reduced by ignoring the folder 'tools' when building.
Further, the quality of the images has been reduced to reduce file size.
